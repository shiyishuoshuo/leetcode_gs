Approach 1: Using Divisors
Intuition
We may realize that it is impossible to construct s by repeating substrings whose length is not a divisor of the length of s.

We only need to look at substrings where the length divides n, where n is the length of s. Another thing that we can notice is that the substring would need to be a prefix of s, otherwise there would be an immediate mismatch.

For each prefix of length i that divides n, we would concatenate the prefix n / i times to generate another string. If this string generated by repeated substrings equals s, we return true.

If no prefix is found that when repeated equals s, we return false.

Algorithm
Create an integer variable n equal to the length of s.
Iterate over all the prefix substrings of length i = 1 to n / 2:
If i divides n, we declare an empty string pattern. Use an inner loop that iterates n / i times to concatenate the substring formed from the first i characters of s.
If pattern equals s, we return true.
There is no substring that can be repeated to form s. As a result, we return false.
